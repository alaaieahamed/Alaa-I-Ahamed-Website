        I am currently a third-year undergraduate at the University of California, Riverside. I hope to apply to M.D or D.O programs during my fourth year. During my senior year in high school, I completed a Medical Assisting course where I received certification, had experience working in a medical office for an externship, and received my national medical assisting certification. After graduating from the medical assisting program, I was able to gain experience working at a medical clinic. My duties as a medical assistant included answering phone calls, keeping files and updating patient records, scheduling appointments, arranging for lab services, greeting patients, preparing examination rooms, assisting medical doctor with any procedures, administering shots, and taking history. I hope to provide support to the patients, physician, and clinic as well as gain experience for my application to medical school. I am also a licensed phlebotomist. I have done more than 50 successful draws. I have experience working with adults as well as geriatric patients. I hope to use this experience to contribute to the overall dynamic of the clinic. I hope to use my experience and education to serve the Riverside community.  <br><br>

        I am currently a volunteer at Riverside Free Clinic where I work with the Diabetes Mellitus Committee to educate patients about different health care measures. As a volunteer I also perform patient consultations to aid patients in progressing towards a healthier lifestyle. I am also a volunteer for Al-Shifa Clinic as well as Riverside Community Hospital where I assist, observe, and contribute to the overall mission. I am currently an undergraduate research assistant. My role in lab is to assist the graduate students and post-doctorate students. I currently have my own project working with a bacteria strain called Enterobacter Cloacae that is isolated from a chronic wound of a diabetic animal model. After isolating this bacterium strain, I perform different manipulations to see how to break down the biofilm and kill the bacteria. We specifically use a chemical compound called N-acetyl Cysteine which if it continues to work then we can potentially use this chemical compound for treatment of chemical compound. 

        I am also a part of the Muslim Student Association at UCR. During the academic year of 2018-2019 I was the public relations and the head of the humanitarian committee. During the year, I set up different collaborations as well as started a few humanitarian events. We were able to make over 300 food and supply kits. This year I am a founded a club called Friends of dialysis. Through this club we offer UCR undergraduates the opportunity to go out the Riverside community to the talk about different preventative healthcare measures. Friends of dialysis also provides UCR students the opportunity to take part in service events and provide patients emotional support as well as different kits that the patients can use during the dialysis sessions. Using my experiences, I hope to advocate for patients and for the patient’s experience. I hope to provide patients a comfortable and relaxing environment. <br><br)
